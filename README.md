# Introduction to jNano
jNano is a Java library used to interface with the official Nano node via RPC requests.
It also includes many native utilities and tools so that a node isn't always necessary.

Almost all of the features have been implemented, however it is still currently a work in progress.
Expecting full completion of the project around the end of March.

**The current version is on the *develop* branch until all utilities have been implemented.**


## Configuring the node
Before using this library, you will need to configure the node correctly.
- If you wish to make RPC requests using this library, [view the queries wiki page](https://github.com/koczadly/jNano/wiki/Query-requests#node-configuration).
- If you are wanting to listen for live blocks on the Nano network, [view the callback wiki page](https://github.com/koczadly/jNano/wiki/Block-callback#node-configuration).
